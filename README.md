# Stick Dungeon
In this game, you control a **stick** figure to survive within a **dungeon**. As stated in the description, this is sort of a cross between a dungeon crawler and a platformer, and it has aspects of both genres. It has several types of rooms (it could probably use more) that are divided into a few distinct types:
* Combat rooms - featuring a random enemy for you to defeat
* Platforming rooms - in which the user must navigate around moving parts while avoiding a fall
* Empty rooms - while they may feature some decorational items, they are devoid of much gameplay opportunities
* "Secret" rooms (not very secret) - they present some sort of puzzle, in which a user who has knowledge of the game can earn a reward.

The main objective is to acquire coins, which are found in treasure chests. These chests can be obtained in their own treasure rooms, which are almost always found after completing a challenge (combat / platforming).
There are three classes (warrior, archer, mage) each with their own weapon type (melee, ranged, magic). Each class gets a bonus in that type of weapon, as well as starting off with different item sets.
There are (as of 3/17/19) 15 types of items currently in the game, as well as an aditional 4 that are planned for but are not yet implemented. More possibly coming in the indeterminate future!
# Installation
It's really simple, but here are the steps anyway
* Download the project
* Move it somewhere besides 'downloads'
* Launch 'stickDungeon.html'

That will give you the latest version (probably unstable). You can also play it online at [happyryan2.github.io](happyryan2.github.io)
